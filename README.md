What Does BackstopJS Do?
BackstopJS is a visual regression testing tool for web applications.
It helps you catch unwanted visual changes in your UI after code updates.

âœ… What BackstopJS Actually Does:
Takes screenshots of selected web pages or UI components (your reference state).

Later, when you update your code, it takes new screenshots.

Then it compares the new screenshots with the reference ones pixel by pixel.

If there are differences, it highlights them visually and generates a browser report.

ðŸ“¦ Why Use BackstopJS?
To prevent visual bugs from sneaking into production.

To make sure new CSS or layout changes don't break existing designs.

Great for CI/CD pipelines, big teams, or design systems.
